<h4>WEB SALES FACILITY TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h4>
<p>Thank you for your interest in using My Plates' Web Sales Facility ("WSF") to obtain specialty license plates ("Plates").  The WSF can be used to apply for new Plates, obtain Restyled Plates (a Plate with a different design from that of the originally issued Plate, but with the same alphanumeric sequence), or purchase My Plates Gift Certificates.  In these Sales Terms, each of these actions is called an "order."  The Plates do not include certain specialty plates that are restricted by TxDOT or applicable law to persons or vehicles that meet special criteria in addition to those set out in the basic TxDOT requirements.  If you request a transaction that the WSF does not handle, the WSF will provide you with a link to the TxDOT website where you can initiate that transaction or directions to contact TxDOT or your county tax assessor-collector.  Orders for Plates made through the WSF are subject to the following terms and conditions (the "Sales Terms").  To place an order, you will be required to check a box indicating that you understand and agree to the Sales Terms.</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE: At this time, only Texas residents may place orders through the WSF.  You may not submit, and it is not My Plates' intention to accept, any information about any individual other than a Texas resident by means of the WSF or any other portion of this Website.</p>
<p>TxDOT Requirements</p>
<p>Although any Texas resident may place an order for Plates through the WSF, you or the person for whom you order them (for example, as a gift) will not be able to use them on a vehicle unless you (or that person) meet the eligibility requirements prescribed by the Texas Department of Transportation ("TxDOT").  When you use the WSF to order Plates for use on a vehicle, you are confirming that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The person on whose vehicle the Plates will be used is a Texas resident, and the title to the vehicle is a Texas title.</li>
<li>The Texas title to the vehicle on which the Plates will be used is either:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>in your name (may be a joint title with another individual), OR</li>
<li>in the name of the person for whom you order them (may be a joint title with another individual), OR</li>
<li>in the name of a third party (for example, the lessor of the vehicle), AND the person who will use the Plates (a) has the legal right to posses and control the vehicle (b) uses the vehicle for personal use, and (c) will execute an affidavit to that effect and present the affidavit to the county tax office when retrieving the Plates.  If the vehicle is leased, a copy of the lease agreement must be presented to the county tax office at the same time.</li>
</ol>
<p>You understand that that the fees you pay for the Plates:</p>
<ol>
<li>are in ADDITION TO, and not in place of, the regular vehicle registration fees,</li>
<li>cover use of the Plates only for the period of time for which you have paid the fees; additional Plate fees will be owed if they will be used on the vehicle for a longer period of time, and</li>
<li>when you collect your Plates from the county tax assessor-collector, the county tax assessor collector may charge an additional, pro-rated vehicle registration fee to synchronize your vehicle registration period with the first annual period for which you have obtained the Plates.</li>
</ol>
<p>Whether you or the person for whom you order Plates intend(s) to use them on a vehicle, for display as a souvenir, or for any other purpose, when you use the WSF to order Plates, you confirm that you understand that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your order is subject to TxDOT/county approval, and even after your order is processed by My Plates, TxDOT or the county may reject your order for any reason.  Your order may be rejected, for example, if TxDOT determines at any time that the personalization of the Plates you order is inappropriate, offensive, or not available for any other reason.  This is not an exhaustive list of the reasons that TxDOT may reject your order.</li>
<li>It is TxDOT policy that Plate fees WILL NOT BE REFUNDED once you have submitted an order for the Plates.</li>
<li>Whether used on a vehicle or not, the Plates will remain the property of the State of Texas, like any other Texas license plates.  You acquire the right to possess the Plates only for the period of time for which you have paid the Plate fees.</li>
<li>Plates (including without limitation their replacement if they are lost, stolen or mutilated) are subject to the provisions of the Texas Transportation Code.  If your Plates are lost, stolen or mutilated, you must contact your county tax assessor-collector.  My Plates is not responsible for replacement of lost, stolen or mutilated Plates.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have questions about TxDOT's requirements, please direct them to TxDOT's Vehicle Title and Registration (VTR) Call Center at (512)-465-7611 or to your local county tax assessor-collector's office.</p>
<p>Fees and Payment</p>
<ul>
<li>All fees are quoted and must be paid in U.S. dollars.</li>
<li>The fees quoted cover the right to use the Plates for a specific period of time, and do not cover any other fees, taxes, duties or charges that may apply (for example, vehicle registration fees).</li>
<li>Fee payments may be made only by use of an accepted credit card, by the credit card holder or with the credit card holder's permission.</li>
<li>My Plates reserves the right to change the price of Plates from time to time without notice (but no price change will affect an order than has been accepted by TxDOT).</li>
</ul>
<p>My Plates Gift Certificates</p>
<p>The terms in this section apply to Gift Certificates that you order or the recipient redeems through the WSF or through My Plates' Customer Service Center.
<ul>
<li>A Gift Certificate expires 6 months after its issue date.</li>
<li>A Gift Certificate may be redeemed only to order new Plates from My Plates.</li>
<li>Gift Certificates have no cash value, cannot be redeemed for cash, and cannot be transferred.</li>
<li>If the fees for Plates ordered using a Gift Certificate are greater than the then outstanding value of the Gift Certificate, the recipient must pay the difference at the time of redeeming the Gift Certificate.  If the fees for the Plates are less than the then outstanding value of the Gift Certificate, the unused value will remain available for the account of the Gift Certificate's recipient, until the Gift Certificate expires.</li>
<li>The issue date and outstanding unredeemed value of the Gift Certificate shall be determined according to My Plates' Gift Certificate records.</li></p>
</ul>
<p>WSF Transactions</p>
<p>In addition to the requirement that you meet TxDOT requirements when you use the WSF to order Plates, you agree and acknowledge that:
<ul>
<li>My Plates accepts payment of the applicable fees only by VISA, AMEX, Discovery or MasterCard. </li>
<li>The Plate fees you pay are paid to and collected by the Texas Comptroller of Pubic Accounts, Treasury Division, not My Plates.</li>
<li>You are responsible for verifying the truth and accuracy of your order.  My Plates will check to make sure that all elements required by TxDOT for a complete order have been provided, but cannot take responsibility for any problems that result from any inaccuracies in the information you provide.</li>
<li>Once you click the <img src="/img/btn_place_order.png" /> button, My Plates will determine whether your order includes all elements required by TxDOT for a Plate order, and if so, will transmit your order to TxDOT electronically.  Upon transmittal to TxDOT:</li>
<ol>
<li>your order will be deemed filed,</li>
<li>no changes or corrections can be made to your order,</li>
<li>Except in the limited circumstances stated immediately below, NO REFUND can be made by My Plates if you decide to cancel the order, and NO CREDITS can be extended by My Plates if you file a new order.</li>
</ol>
</ul></p>
<p>If TxDOT rejects your order because the alphanumeric combination you chose is not acceptable or otherwise not available, My Plates will contact you so that you can select another alphanumeric combination or request a refund of the fees paid from My Plates.</p>
<p>Manufacture and Delivery of Plates</p>
<ul>
<li>Manufacture of your Plates and delivery to your county tax assessor-collector's office generally takes 14 business days after your order has been accepted by TxDOT.  TxDOT secures manufacture of the Plates from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.  My Plates does not control the timing of these processes, and does not control the production of the Plates or the quality control and assurance standards applied to them.</li>
<li>Delivery of the manufactured Plates to the county tax assessor-collector is made by U.S. Postal Service.  The cost of this delivery is included in the order fee.  To verify when your Plates are ready to be picked up, you should contact your county tax assessor-collector's office before you go to collect them.  You will be required to go to the tax assessor-collector's office to retrieve your Plates, and will be required to sign for them and confirm your identity at that time.  If you intend to use the Plates on your vehicle, you will be required to provide the tax assessor-collector with additional information and you may be asked to pay an additional fee.</li>
<li>PLEASE NOTE: Representations of Plates on this Website and in My Plates' advertising materials are for illustrative purposes only.  The colors, shades, shapes, sizes and spacing of graphics and letters that you see displayed on your computer monitor and printed receipt may vary from the actual Plates due to computer, printing, manufacturing and other variables beyond the control of My Plates and TxDOT.</li>
</ul></p>

<li>You understand, acknowledge and agree that:</li>
<ul>
<li>My Plates is not liable for delays or failures to perform that result from any cause beyond My Plates' reasonable control, including but not limited to the actions or omissions of TxDOT, the providers of credit card payment system services, the Plate manufacturer, the U.S. Postal Service, or any other third party involved providing goods or services necessary to fulfill your order, acts of God, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, disruptions of communications systems or other causes that may be regarded as a "force majeure."</li>

<p>Applicable Law</p>
