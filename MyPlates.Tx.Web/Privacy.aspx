<h2>PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
<p>My Plates is firmly committed to protecting your privacy. We understand and appreciate that visitors and users of the My Plates website (the “Website”) and the My Plates Web Sales Facility (the “WSF”) are concerned about their privacy and the confidentiality and security of any information that may be provided to us. We therefore aim to maintain a safe and secure system of handling your personally identifiable information and to assure that your personal information is handled in strict compliance with applicable law.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT NOTICE:  At this time, the Website is intended for use primarily by Texas residents.  Residents of other states and jurisdictions may view the Website, subject to My Plates’ Website Terms (click HERE to view), but may not use the WSF or otherwise submit any personal or personally identifiable information to My Plates.  My Plates does not intend to collect personal or personally identifiable information of any individuals who are not Texas residents.  This is a United States website, and is subject to the laws of the United States and of the State of Texas.</p>
<h4>Cookies</h4>
<p>The Website uses cookies to enable My Plates to provide a customized online experience, and to enable you to use the WSF.  A cookie is a text file sent by a website web server to your computer.  Some cookies remain on your computer only until you close your web browser (session cookies); other cookies remain until you delete them or they expire.  The cookies our web server sends to your computer do not collect any personally identifiable information (see below), unless you use the WSF.  Cookies that My Plates uses to make the WSF work enable our web server to keep track of the details of your order, and for that purpose may collect personally identifiable information that you voluntarily disclose to My Plates.  You may reject cookies sent to your computer by My Plates’ web server and still view informational pages on the Website, but if you wish to use the WSF, your computer must accept cookies from us.  You may delete My Plates cookies after you have completed your WSF transaction.</p>
<p>Collection of Personally Identifiable Information</p>
<p>My Plates collects from you only the personally identifiable information that you voluntarily provide to us (“your Personal Information”) because it is necessary for us to review, process and track your specialty plate orders, including but not limited to information required by the Texas Department of Transportation (“TxDOT”), who issues the plates.  Depending on the type of order, your Personal Information may be about you or about another person (for example, about the person for whom you are ordering specialty plates or a Gift Certificate, or about the person whose credit card you are using, with that person’s permission, to pay the fees for the order).  The type of order also determines the type of information My Plates may collect.</p>
<p>Please be aware that when you view the Website, our Internet Service Provider (our “ISP”) may make a record of your visit and logs the following information for statistical purposes.  Such information may include:</p>
	•	the IP address of the server through which you access the Internet
	•	your top level domain name (for example .com)
	•	the pages you accessed and documents downloaded
	•	the previous site you have visited
	•	the type of browser you are using
<p>This information is held by the ISP.  My Plates does not associate specific customers with any of the information collected by the ISP.</p>

<div class="column-2">
<h4>Use and Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information</h4>
<p>Except for the very limited purposes described below, My Plates will only use your Personal Information for the purpose of reviewing, processing and tracking your specialty plate orders.  For example, My Plates will use your mailing address and email address to send you print and electronic confirmation of your orders.  In reviewing, processing and tracking your order, we may disclose your Personal Information to parties with whom My Plates has contracted for services necessary to reviewing, processing or tracking your specialty plate orders (for example, to process your fee payments made by credit card).  Third party contractors to whom we disclose your Personal Information are obligated to us to maintain the privacy, confidentiality and security of your Personal Information, and are permitted to use it only for the purpose of providing services to My Plates.  Of course, My Plates must disclose portions of your Personal Information to TxDOT and to your county tax assessor-collector (from whom you will retrieve the specialty plates).</p>
<p>My Plates may use statistical information obtained from its ISP and may analyze information about use of the Website and the WSF to help it improve its marketing efforts.  My Plates will not sell or otherwise make this information or third parties.  My Plates will not provide your Personal Information to any other third party unless we are required to do so by law.</p>
<h4>Children’s Online Privacy</h4>
<p>My Plates fully subscribes to the protection of the privacy of children.  For that reason, the Website is not structured to attract children under the age of 13 or otherwise directed toward them.  My Plates will not collect or maintain personal information from children who we actually know to be under age 13.  My Plates policy is to comply in all respects with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection  Act (COPPA).</p>
<h4>Security</h4>
<p>On pages where you input and My Plates collects your Personal Information, the information is transferred to us using the Secured Socket Layer (SSL) protocol, to protect your Personal Information with an extremely high level of encryption.  The padlock symbol displayed by your browser indicates which pages of the Website are covered by this security technology.  My Plates provides third party verification of its SSL use; you can verify this by clicking on the <table width="10" border="0" cellspacing="0" align="center">

</table> on the pages involved.</p>
<p>My Plates employs physical, electronic and managerial tools and procedures to secure your electronically stored Personal Information.  For example, once your Personal Information reaches My Plates, it is stored on a secure server behind firewalls designed unauthorized access from outside of My Plates.  My Plates may hire third parties to store and manage such information, or to provide information technology services relating to My Plates electronic information storage and processing systems, provided that they observe the same or equivalent security and privacy guidelines.  However, because of the inherent risks associated with the Internet, neither My Plates nor any other similarly situated business or entity, can provide a 100% guaranty of data security.  If a security breach caused by hackers, other third parties or events not reasonably within My Plates’ control occurs, My Plates will comply with legal requirements regarding notice of the breach.  You agree that My Plates’ will have no liability to you relating to such a security breach except to provide you with the legally required notice.  If you do not agree to this waiver, you should not provide personally identifiable information to My Plates.</p>
<h4>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h4>
<p>My Plates will not change its commitment to safeguarding the privacy, confidentiality and security of your Personal Information, but the details of our policies for doing so may be modified from time to time.  No change to this Privacy Policy will be effective before it is posted on the Website.  When posted, the modified Privacy Policy will become effective without further notice to you.  For that reason, My Plates asks that you review our Privacy Policy whenever you visit the Website so that you are always aware of the applicable policy.  This Privacy Policy was last updated in August 2008.</p>
