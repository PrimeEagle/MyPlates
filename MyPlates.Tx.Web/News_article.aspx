<h3>Texans Preview My Plates<br />
<span class="small">June 24, 2008</span></h3>
<p>AUSTIN – Texans are invited to electronically view an array of proposed new specialty license plate designs and share their thoughts starting Monday on the Texas Department of Transportation’s (TxDOT) Web site, www.txdot.gov. </p>
<p>The 31 new designs – three of them for motorcycles - are expected to be the first ones offered by My Plates, the company that was awarded the contract by TxDOT to handle the marketing and sale of new specialty license plates that will boost the state’s revenue. A portion of the sales from these plates will be deposited in the state’s General Revenue Fund, which provides services for all Texans.</p>
<p>Three of the proposed designs are familiar to Texans. In February, they were part of the e-Vote that allowed Texans to choose the state’s next general-issue license plate. While these three designs were not chosen by the majority of Texans, they were still popular with tens of thousands of them and are among the 31 proposed new specialty plate designs. <br />Texans can view and comment on the proposed designs from 7 a.m. today, June 24, to 5 p.m. July 3 by going to the TxDOT Web site, www.txdot.gov, and typing “e-View” or “new plates” in the search engine. </p>
<p>“Texans are known for their individuality and these new specialty license plates provide a fun way for them to express themselves,” said Rebecca Davio, director of TxDOT’s Vehicle Titles and Registration Division. “We’re excited that My Plates will offer a variety of colors and designs that allows Texans to be creative and at the same time help increase revenue for the state.”</p>
<p>When the new designs are approved, My Plates will offer them online at www.myplates.com later this summer. Texans will be able to personalize any of the new specialty license plates. </p>
<p>“We are building a dynamic new Web site that we believe Texans will find as exciting as the new specialty plates themselves,” said James Power, president of My Plates. “We plan to offer outstanding customer service and the ordering process, whether online or by calling us, is going to be user-friendly for every Texan.</p>
<p> ”Whether you go online or prefer to call our professionally staffed customer service center, we’ll make it effortless for you to express yourself and add character to your car, truck or motorcycle,” Power added.</p>
<p>This innovative public-private partnership, which does not cost taxpayers a dime, is the first of its kind in the country. My Plates has guaranteed to pay the state at least $40 million over the next five years. TxDOT receives $8 from every specialty plate sale to cover manufacturing and administrative costs, and the remainder of the money is divided between the state and My Plates.<br />
